# Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer

Search for putative high impact variants in genes associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer.

## Why pancreatic cancer?

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with an average 5-year survival rate of 8.2%.

Some people might be at increased risk of pancreatic cancer because of a family history of the disease. Sometimes this increased risk is due to a specific genetic syndrome, which can be tested for. Knowing if you are at increased risk can help your doctor decide if you should have tests to look for pancreatic cancer early, when it might be easier to treat.

## What does this app do?

This omics app searches for putative high impact variants in 15 genes associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer and other genetic diseases with increased risk factor for pancreatic cancer: APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, STK11, TP53, VHL, ATM, CDK4.

## What to do next?

If you have a putative high impact variant in one of the genes associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer, it is recommended to speak with a health care professional because you may be at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

If you do NOT have a putative high impact variant in one of the 15 genes, it does not mean you are protected from developing hereditary pancreatic cancer.
